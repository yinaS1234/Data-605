## Problem Statement

7 . A die is rolled until the first time T that a six turns up.
(a) What is the probability distribution for T?
(b) Find P(T > 3).
(c) Find P(T > 6|T > 3)


### (a) What is the probability distribution for \(T\)?

The probability distribution for \(T\), where \(T\) is the trial on which the first six appears, follows a geometric distribution with success probability \(p = 1/6\).

### (b) Find \(P(T > 3)\).

```{r}
#you have a 5 in 6 chance of NOT getting the 6 each time.
p_t_gt_3 <- (5/6)^3
p_t_gt_3

```

### (c) Find \(P(T > 6 | T > 3)\).
```{r}
#giving you the probability of not getting the six in the next 3 tries, given that you haven't gotten it in the first 3 tries.
p_t_gt_6_given_t_gt_3 <- (5/6)^6 / (5/6)^3
p_t_gt_6_given_t_gt_3
```
